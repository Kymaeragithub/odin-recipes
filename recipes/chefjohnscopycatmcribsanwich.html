       I tip my cap to a certain fast food franchise for coming up 
       with the idea for a boneless baby back rib sandwich, 
       the only downside being that they use about 60 mystery ingredients-- 
       ribs not necessarily being one of them. 
       That's why you should try this easy homemade version with real ribs;
       simply bake, chill, cut, sauce, finish on the grill, and voila! 
       One of the best sandwiches I've ever had.
